# CropConnect 🌾

**CropConnect – Fair & Direct Crop Marketplace**

CropConnect is an open-source platform designed to connect farmers directly with NGOs and bulk buyers. The platform enables fair price negotiation, reduces dependency on intermediaries, and aims to minimize crop wastage.

## 🚩 Problem

Farmers often face unstable pricing, middlemen margins, and difficulties selling produce at profitable rates. Bulk buyers such as NGOs and community kitchens struggle with affordable and reliable sourcing.

## ✅ Solution

CropConnect provides a transparent digital marketplace where:

- Farmers list crops with quantity & pricing
- Buyers browse available produce
- Buyers submit offers
- Farmers accept / reject / counter offers

## ✨ Features (Hackathon MVP)

- Farmer & Buyer Registration
