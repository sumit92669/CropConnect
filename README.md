# 🌾 CropConnect  
### Fair & Direct Crop Marketplace

CropConnect is an open-source platform connecting **farmers** directly with **NGOs & bulk buyers**.  
It enables transparent price negotiation, reduces middlemen dependency, and helps minimize crop wastage.

## 🚩 Problem

Farmers often face:

- Unstable crop pricing  
- Heavy intermediary margins  
- Difficulty reaching bulk buyers  

At the same time, NGOs struggle with affordable & reliable sourcing.

## ✅ Solution

CropConnect provides a transparent digital marketplace:

✔ Farmers list crops (price & quantity)  
✔ Buyers browse available produce  
✔ Buyers submit offers
